# polkadot

second weeks exercise, using enums and options to handle a given input of basic arithmetic operation.
since this program takes three arguments (number_1 operand number_3 respectively) there were no need to parse
input into a calculation tree so parsing is pretty straightforward. tried to make it error prone so that it would not crash
on wrong inputs.
